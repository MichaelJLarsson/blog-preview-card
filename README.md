## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I deepened my knowledge abaout how to use `clamp()` for fluid fonts.

### Continued development

I want to continue to explore how to use `clamp()` while also maintaining accessibility when changing the root font size.

### Useful resources

- [Font-size Clamp Generator](https://clamp.font-size.app) - A nifty helper to calculate `clamp()` properties.
- [CSS-Trix](https://css-tricks.com/linearly-scale-font-size-with-css-clamp-based-on-the-viewport/) - Goes down the rabbit hole of how to calculate `clamp()` values.
